## SHO/SHMSimulation
- these simulate unforced simple harmonic motion
- mass, damping coefficient, and spring constant can be adjusted
- equation of motion is determined analytically

## FHO/FHMSimulation
- these simulate forced harmonic motion
- mass, damping coefficient, spring constant, forcing function can be adjusted
- equation of motion is determined using eulers method
