## SHO/SHMSimulation
- These simulate unforced simple harmonic motion
- Mass, damping coefficient, and spring constant can be adjusted
- Equation of motion is determined analytically
- As the motion is determined analytically, changing dt will not have signifiant impacts

## FHO/FHMSimulation
- These simulate forced harmonic motion
- Mass, damping coefficient, spring constant, forcing function can be adjusted
- Equation of motion is determined using eulers method
- To make more accurate, reduce dt
