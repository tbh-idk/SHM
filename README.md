## SHO/SHMSimulation
- These simulate unforced simple harmonic motion
- Mass, damping coefficient, and spring constant can be adjusted
- Equation of motion is determined analytically

## FHO/FHMSimulation
- These simulate forced harmonic motion
- Mass, damping coefficient, spring constant, forcing function can be adjusted
- Equation of motion is determined using eulers method
